# movie-project

An exercise in web-scraping and iterative API calls. 

The goals of this project were to further our understanding of web-scraping and making API requests.

We set out to collect data pertaining to Comedy movies of the last 20 years from IMDB. After identifying properly filtered webpages, we scraped the desired imdb ID's for 1000 movies sorted by imdb Box Office.

After obtaining the ID's we made API requests for each and parsed the data for entry into SQL database.
