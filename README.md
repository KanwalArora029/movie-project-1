# movie-project
By Julia Chong and Rob Zifchak
We decided to pick comedy movies as our genre, and we wanted to identify key factors that contribute to success. 
Some examples include popularity, critic ratings, runtime, user ratings, budget, actors, director, and release year.
We picked IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to webscrape from. IMDb is based on user ratings, while Rotten Tomatoes is based on professional critic ratings. We believe it is important to include both in order to see which is a better determinant of success.
We picked https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/ to obtain data through an API.
